From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the sixth monster, called City-Face. He was vexed when he could not find it and went back to the Mourning Hold in secret anger, killing a mystic that asked about higher order.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNerevar, the Hortator, witnessed this and said, 'Why do this, milord? The mystics look to you for guidance. They work to make your temple better stoned.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec said, 'No one knows what I am.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Hortator nodded and went back to his studies.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHere is how City-Face hid from his mother-father: it had been born named as Ha-Note, a bare urge of power, an esoteric wind nerve tuned to the frequency of huddled masses. It found root in villages and multiplied, finding in the minds of the settled a veiled astrology, the star charts of culture, and this resonance made its head swim. Ha-Note moved sideways into the Adjacent Place, growing and unbeknownst. Above the vocal, it trembled with new emotions, immortal ones, absorbing more than the thirty known to exist in the middle world. When Ha-Note became gravely homesick, the Grabbers took it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA Grabber said, 'New emotions to the lonely occur only of madness. This thing is gone. It is ours now.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGrabbers had never made a city of their own, and their glimpse of Vivec's, which shone with holiness through all the spheres, had taken their attention.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'Under this reason did the issue of Vehk slide into our realm, drawn by our coveting, hidden in loss. We shall build our tower-hope upon its face.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNow many years had passed in Resdaynia, and the high priests of the Dwemer were building something alike as Vivec and alike as the new Ha-Note of the Grabbers. The Hortator was engaged with an army of theirs that had become too brave, talking foolish words, and Nerevar helped destroy them with the help of the orphan legion of Ayem. When he went to give trophy to Vivec, he saw his lord under attack by the City-Face. The monster was saying this:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'Here we are to replace your city, Vehk and Vehk. We are from the place of the more-than-known emotions, and our citizenry has died from it. Two things we came for, but can stay for only one. Either we ask you to correct our error of culture, or merely take yours by dint of force. The second is easiest, we think.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec sighed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'You would replace my direction,' he said. 'I weary of this, though I wanted to kill you an age before. Resdaynia is fallen ill, and I have no time for one more imaginary analogy of an unknown incident. Here, take this.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt which he touched the tower-hope of the City-Face and corrected the error of the Grabbers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'And this.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAt which he stabbed the heart of the City-Face with the Ethos Knife, which is to say RKHT AI AE ALTADOON AI, the short blade of proper commerce. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ending of the words is ALMSIVI.<BR>\r\n",
