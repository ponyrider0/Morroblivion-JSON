Their succulent pods are often the only nourishment for adventurers who find themselves in the wilderness without rations.  It is said that black and white poppies imbibed together have magical properties.  When they are crushed and mixed with the milk of the agile-footed mountain goat, the resulting potion allows the user to glide safely aboveground.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFire Fern, a perennial herb, is native to the province of Morrowind.  The flowers are inconspicuous and often hidden.  The glossy, evergreen foliage and blossoms are resistant to conditions of high heat and bright light.  A petal from this plant placed under the adventurer's tongue will provide protection from the heat and fire of the lava pits and thermal streams around Dagoth-Ur.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDragon's Tongue, a common name for a fernlike herb found in Black Marsh, is especially prolific around the area of the Ultherus Swamp.  It is a beautiful wildflower whose name comes from the fire-red fronds that protect its golden efflorescence.  As pretty as it is, however, it is a deadly poison to most living beings and needs to be avoided by adventurers, especially unprotected ones, as it is lethal to the touch.  It is said, however, that Argonians can handle the plant and use the sap derived from its roots to enhance their endurance.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDomica Redwort is an herb grown by many residents of Valenwood for their beautiful and showy flowers.  They attain a height of about three feet and sport feathery leaves; the flowers are usually bright red.  In addition to their beauty, they are said to have the magical ability of enhancing the appearance of anyone who carries or wears one of the blooms.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIronwood Nut is a hard-shelled fruit that comes from the ironwood trees growing deep in the forests of Skyrim.  The wood of these trees is hard as the metal after which it is named.  The very rare black variety of ironwood is said to produce a nut which is very succulent and believed to greaten the strength of the adventurer who is able to crack its shell and partake of it.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Ginko leaves which are found along the banks of rivers and lakes in Hammerfell are most inconspicuous, only their peculiar half-moon shape making them noticeable.  The edible foliage is very sweet and quite tasty.  Legend has it that when mixed properly with the pulp of the aloe plant, the resulting concoction has the ability of increasing one's stamina for a short while.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Somnalius Fern can be found in the swamps of Black Marsh.  The fronds of this plant are light green and quite delicate.  Picking a frond can be very difficult, as they usually crumble to the touch, but once retrieved it can be used to put an enemy to sleep for a short while by passing it under his nose.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nArrowroot is a thick, rubbery tuber that can be found in the province of Valenwood.  The plant is quite difficult to find as its aboveground foliage is very meager and scrawny.  But the root itself can be most beneficial to the gatherer as it has magical properties.  The paste made from grinding the root is quite wholesome and can improve the user's accuracy with a bow and arrow, or other missile weapon.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNightshade is reputed to be a very poisonous herb.  However, the variety found in many parts of Elsweyr is cherished by Khajiits who have taken up careers in thievery.  Many Khajiits will tuck a piece of Nightshade inside their armor to increase their abilities to skulk, hide, and become invisible.  <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
