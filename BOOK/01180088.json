It is the best selling of the Temple annotated texts, and therefore inexpensive and commonly found in most Dunmer households. Saryoni collects Vivec's most famous sermons and the popular explanations of his Gospels. This text exists in many editions. More elaborate editions are handsomely illuminated with Vivec's quotations from the Gospels for days, seasons, and festivals.] <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nListen, faithful, to Vivec's words, for he says five times and five ways --<BR>\r\nForge a keen Faith in the crucible of suffering.<BR>\r\nEngrave upon thy eye the image of injustice.<BR>\r\nDeath does not diminish; the ghost gilds with glory.<BR>\r\nFaith conquers all. Let us yield to Faith.<BR>\r\nBetter to suffer a wrong than to do one.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHear the words of Lord Vivec, and heed his sermons on the Seven Graces, for he names them seven times and seven ways --<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVALOR<BR>\r\nDARING<BR>\r\nJUSTICE<BR>\r\nCOURTESY<BR>\r\nPRIDE<BR>\r\nGENEROSITY<BR>\r\nHUMILITY<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Valor<BR>\r\nThank you for your valor, Lord Vivec. I shall not quail, nor turn away, but face my enemies and my fear.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Daring<BR>\r\nThank you for your daring, Lord Vivec. I shall not shun risk, nor hide behind the mask of cautious counsel, for fortune favors the bold.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Justice<BR>\r\nThank you for your justice, Lord Vivec. I shall be neither cruel nor arbitrary, for fair dealing earns the love, trust, and respect of our people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Courtesy<BR>\r\nThank you for your courtesy, Lord Vivec. I shall speak neither hurtful nor harsh word, but shall speak respectfully, even of my enemies, for temperate words may turn aside anger.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Pride<BR>\r\nThank you for your pride, Lord Vivec. I shall not doubt myself, or my people, or my gods, and shall insist upon them, and my ancient rights.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Generosity<BR>\r\nThank you for your generosity, Lord Vivec. I shall neither hoard nor steal, nor encumber myself with profitless treasures, but shall share freely among house and hearth.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Humilty<BR>\r\nThank you for your humility, Lord Vivec. I shall neither strut nor preen in vanity, but shall know and give thanks for my place in the greater world.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
