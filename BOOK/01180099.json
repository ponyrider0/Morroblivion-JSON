He answered that with respect to the theories of Kagrenac, there was but one scholar near who could guide the people through the maze that leads to true misunderstanding.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe informed me, however, that in Kherakah the precepts of Kagrenac were taught.  He said that nothing pleased him more than to see the Dwemer of Kherakah, the most learned people in the world, studying Kagrenac's words and giving consideration to their place in the life to come, and where neither planar division nor the numeration of amnesia nor any other thing of utility was more valued than the understanding of the self and its relationship to the Heart.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI was gracious enough to receive this as a high compliment, and, removing my helm, I thanked him and departed with an infinity of bows.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
