I have found nothing new in the ruins. Everything seems as clean and undisturbed as the day we first opened the outer doors. I know there are unexplored depths. I can feel massive Dwemer machinery still running beneath my feet, even as I write this, but I can find no way to get to it. You must not give up on us for a lack results this soon, Edwinna. I am sure a great discovery lies somewhere below.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf only the secret of Passwall were not lost nearly a generation ago. With a few of those precious scrolls, I would be in the lower levels already where the real discoveries are to be made.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere is some good news. I have also discovered that \"Mzuleft\" you were looking for. Apparently \"Mzuleft\" is the proper name for the large Dwemer ruins south of Dagon Fel. Be careful not to confuse them with the ruins of \"Nchardahrk\" nearby.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe last of the Dwemer centurion spiders in the upper levels was finally disabled and dismantled for study. I wish we could study them while they are still active, but that is far too dangerous.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI also heard a strange story about the centurion spider that we captured and sent back to Cyrodiil. The ship captain I hired wrote to me with an odd story. He said that the spider nearly broke through its cage several times while near Vvardenfell, but once he left he Sea of Ghosts, the centurion suddenly stopped working. What happened next shows that he had more wits than I gave him credit for. He ordered the ship turned about and as they approached Vvardenfell again, the centurion began moving just as suddenly. This is a curious phenomenon and certainly deserves more investigation.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYour servant,<BR>\r\nSenilius Cadiusus<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
