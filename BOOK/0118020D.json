I regret that his corpse still holds the key to the tomb I must reach in order to achieve the mission. I am left alone, with only blade and skill to accomplish this task. I believe I have come to the end of my journey. But, without the key, I find myself in the position of forcing entry. For, behind this door, I am sure an evil terror awaits. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI leave this warning in case I do not make it. Surely, this door is trapped, and my lockpicking and disarming ability leaves much to be desired. If someone happens across my body, know that I have failed, and know that there is surely a great prize, the Staff of Hasedoki, awaiting further into this evil tomb. Beware the keeper of the great staff. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVulpriss Denisson<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCarmella, I shall see you on the peaceful plains, with all my love.<BR>\r\n",
