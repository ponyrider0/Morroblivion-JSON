Let us yield to Faith.<BR>\r\nBetter to suffer a wrong than to do one.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHear the words of Lord Vivec, and heed his sermons on the Seven Graces, for he names them seven times and seven ways --<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVALOR<BR>\r\nDARING<BR>\r\nJUSTICE<BR>\r\nCOURTESY<BR>\r\nPRIDE<BR>\r\nGENEROSITY<BR>\r\nHUMILITY<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Valor<BR>\r\nThank you for your valor, Lord Vivec. I shall not quail, nor turn away, but face my enemies and my fear.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Daring<BR>\r\nThank you for your daring, Lord Vivec. I shall not shun risk, nor hide behind the mask of cautious counsel, for fortune favors the bold.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Justice<BR>\r\nThank you for your justice, Lord Vivec. I shall be neither cruel nor arbitrary, for fair dealing earns the love, trust, and respect of our people.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Courtesy<BR>\r\nThank you for your courtesy, Lord Vivec. I shall speak neither hurtful nor harsh word, but shall speak respectfully, even of my enemies, for temperate words may turn aside anger.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Pride<BR>\r\nThank you for your pride, Lord Vivec. I shall not doubt myself, or my people, or my gods, and shall insist upon them, and my ancient rights.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Generosity<BR>\r\nThank you for your generosity, Lord Vivec. I shall neither hoard nor steal, nor encumber myself with profitless treasures, but shall share freely among house and hearth.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Grace of Humilty<BR>\r\nThank you for your humility, Lord Vivec. I shall neither strut nor preen in vanity, but shall know and give thanks for my place in the greater world.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
