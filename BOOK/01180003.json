He said, 'From here I shall launch my attack on the eight monsters.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nVivec then saw the moths that would come from the starry heart, bringing with them dust more horrible than the ash of Red Mountain. He saw the twin head of a ruling king who had no equivalent. And eight imperfections rubbed into precious stones, set into a crown that looked like shackles, which he understood to be the twin crowns of the two-headed king. And a river that fed into the mouth of the two-headed king, because he contained multitudes. <BR>\r\nVivec then built the Provisional House at the Center of the Secret Door. From here he could watch the age to come. Of the House is written:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCornerstone one has a finger<BR>\r\nBuried under, pointing through<BR>\r\nDirt, slow low in the ground<BR>\r\nNorth cannot be guessed,<BR>\r\nAnd yet it is spirit-free<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCornerstone two has a tongue,<BR>\r\nAnd even dust can be talkative,<BR>\r\nListen and you will see the love<BR>\r\nThe ancient libraries need<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCornerstone three has a bit of string,<BR>\r\nShaped like your favorite color,<BR>\r\nA girl remembers who left it there<BR>\r\nBut she is afraid to dig it out,<BR>\r\nAnd see what it is attached to<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCornerstone four has nine bones,<BR>\r\nRemoved carefully from a black cat,<BR>\r\nArranged in the fashion of this word,<BR>\r\nProtecting us from our enemies<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYour house is safe now<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo why is it--<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYour house is safe now<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSo why is it--<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ending of the words is ALMSIVI.<BR>\r\n",
