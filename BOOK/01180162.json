This orphan and outcast is called in legend the \"Nerevarine,\" and is supposed to be a reincarnation of the long-dead Dunmer General and First Councilor, Lord Indoril Nerevar.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe outlander has the appearance of meeting the conditions of this local superstition. Therefore it is his Majesty's desire that this person shall, insofar as is possible, satisfy the conditions of this ancient prophecy, and shall become the Nerevarine.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough this prophecy is indeed only an ancient local superstition, his Majesty has taken counsel on this matter with his most expert informants and confidants, and his Majesty is persuaded that the prophecy is genuine and significant, either in its entirety, or in its several parts, and he earnestly demands you treat this matter with the utmost seriousness.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCertain aspects of this ancient superstition are described at the end of this document, and further materials will be forthcoming by courier at the earliest occasion. It will, of course, be necessary that you acquaint yourself better with the details of this ancient superstition from your local sources. It is imperitive that you employ the new arrival to gather information on this subject. His Majesty has taken a great personal interest in the legends and prophecies of the Nerevarine, and eagerly awaits your reports.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most Humble and Obedient Servant,<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGlabrio Bellienus<BR>\r\nPersonal Secretary to the Emperor<BR>\r\n",
