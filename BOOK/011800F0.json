Both Temple and Empire outlaw the cult, but it persists among the Ashlanders, despite Imperial and Temple repression. Because it is persecuted, it remains a secret cult, and it is hard to judge how widespread it is among the Ashlanders, or whether it has any following outside the Ashlander tribes.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Nerevarine<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Ashlanders firmly believe that Nerevar will return to restore the glories of ancient Resdayn. [Morrowind was called 'Resdayn' before the Imperial Occupation.] The Ashlanders say the Great Houses and the Temple have abandoned the pure teachings of the Prophet Veloth, forsaking ancestor worship for the false gods of the Tribunal, and embracing the comforts of civilization that corrupted the High Elves. The Temple, on the other hand, venerates Saint Nerevar, but rejects the disgusting notion that the False Incarnate will walk the earth like a ghoul.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNerevar<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Temple honors Saint Nerevar as the greatest Dunmer general, First Councilor, and companion of Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, who united the Dunmer Houses to destroy the evil Dwemer, the treacherous House Dagoth, and their Western allies at Red Mountain. But the Ashlanders say Nerevar promised to honor the Ancient Spirits and the Tribal law, and that he will come again to honor that promise. To the Ashlanders, this means destroying the false Temple and driving the Imperial invaders from the land.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNerevarine Prophecies<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDream visions and prophecies are a respected tradition in Ashlander culture. Their wise women and shamans take careful note of dreams and visions, and pass on the tribe's legacies of vision and prophecy to their successors. By contrast, the Temple and the Western faiths are suspicious of mysticism, and they regard interpretation of dreams and visions as primitive superstition.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe most common version of the Nerevarine Prophecy is THE STRANGER. The verses are obscure, as are most prophecies. But two observations are in order. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFirst, many less-well-informed scholars assume that the phrase \"journeyed far 'neath moon and star\" is just a cliche to suggest a very long journey, but the Nerevar of legend was known to possess a magical ring named \"One-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star,\" upon which Nerevar is supposed to have sworn his promise to honor ancient Ashlander traditions and land rights.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSecond, the reference to \"seven curses\" must certainly refer to the lost prophetic verses known to the Ashlanders as the SEVEN CURSES.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTHE STRANGER<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen earth is sundered, and skies choked black,<BR>\r\nAnd sleepers serve the seven curses,<BR>\r\nTo the hearth there comes a stranger,<BR>\r\nJourneyed far 'neath moon and star.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough stark-born to sire uncertain<BR>\r\nHis aspect marks his certain fate.<BR>\r\nWicked stalk him, righteous curse him.<BR>\r\nProphets speak, but all deny.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany trials make manifest<BR>\r\nThe stranger's fate, the curses' bane.<BR>\r\nMany touchstones try the stranger<BR>\r\nMany fall, but one remains.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLost Prophecies<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAshlander elders complain of prophecies which have been lost to tribal memory due to the carelessness or ineptitude of earlier generations of wise women and ashkhans. Suspicious scholars wonder whether these prophecies might have been deliberately forgotten or suppressed. Three Nerevarine prophecies in particular are said to have been lost: 1. The Lost Prophecies; 2. The Seven Curses; and 3. Seven Visions of Seven Trials of the Incarnate. Perhaps these lost prophecies will someday be found, either in forgotten accounts written by literate travelers, or in the memories of isolated Ashlanders, or in the secret traditions of the wise women and shamans.<BR>\r\n",
