His only mystery is an invitation to elaborate further.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Mother is active and clawed like a nix-hound, yet she is the holiest of those that reclaim their days.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Son is myself, Vehk, and I am unto three, six, nine, and the rest that come after, glorious and sympathetic, without borders, utmost in the perfections of this world and the others, sword and symbol, pale like gold.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere is a fourth kind of philosophy that uses nothing but disbelief.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the sword I mean the sensible.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the word I mean the dead.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI am Vehk, your protector and the protector of Red Mountain until the end of days, which are numbered 3333.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBelow me is the savage, which we needed to remove ourselves from the Altmer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAbove me is a challenge, which bathes itself in fire and the essence of a god.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThrough me you are desired, unlike the prophets that have borne your name before.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSix are the walking ways, from enigma to enemy to teacher.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBoethiah and Azura are the principles of the universal plot, which is begetting, which is creation, and Mephala makes of it an art form.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the sword I mean the first night.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the word I mean the dead.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere will be a splendor in your name when it is said to be true.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSix are the guardians of Veloth, three before and they are born again, and they will test you until you have the proper tendencies of the hero.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere is a world that is sleeping and you must guard against it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the sword I mean the dual nature.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the word I mean animal life.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the sword I mean preceded by a sigh.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor by the word I mean preceded by a wolf.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ending of the words is ALMSIVI.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
