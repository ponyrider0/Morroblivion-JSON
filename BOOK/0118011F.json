I had to run some old documents over to the Inquisitor at the Ministry of Truth, and I'm likely to be tied up there for a while. Why don't you meet me there as soon as you can? Then we can leave together as soon as I'm done. And Amaya, don't forget to bring me the two Divine Intervention scrolls you borrowed. Or, if you used them, buy a couple of new ones for me. I think I'm going to need them soon. Janand Maulinie at the Mages Guild in the Foreign Quarter keeps them in stock.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAlvela Saram is the guard at the entrance; just tell her you're looking for me, and she'll let you in.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYour faithful friend,<BR>\r\nMehra<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPS: I left a couple of Levitate potions here for you, just in case. I couldn't remember if you knew the spell or not, so I drew a couple from stock.<BR>",
