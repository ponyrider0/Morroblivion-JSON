Turn left, northwest, and pass the village of Pelagiad on your right. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe road continues north, then swings northeast until it reaches a four-way intersection. The road to Balmora turns left, northwest, and descends into Foyada Mamaea, a deep volcanic ravine. The road follows the ravine northeast for a short distance, then turns left and climbs out of the ravine to the northwest.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNorth of the ravine, pass Fort Moonmoth on the right and come to an intersection with a signpost. Head due west towards Balmora.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTwo small bridges cross the Odai River. On the west side of the river, go north, passing the silt strider port and entering the walls of Balmora.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMind the signposts, and be careful. In bad weather or darkness, it is easy to stray from the road.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
